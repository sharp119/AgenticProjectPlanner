# Docgen Orchestrator AI Agent

This system combines specialized AI agents to create comprehensive project documentation from initial concept through implementation planning. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of project documentation and works together to create a cohesive set of planning documents.

## Overview

The Project Documentation AI Agent takes a project scope as input and produces a complete set of planning documents by:

1. Asking targeted questions about project requirements
2. Analyzing responses to understand project goals and constraints
3. Generating structured documentation according to industry best practices
4. Presenting information in clear, actionable formats

## Available Expert Agents

This system includes specialized agents for:

- Project Identity & Purpose Definition
- Design Philosophy Development
- Layout & Color System Specification
- Development Planning


Additional domain-specific agents can be added as needed.

## How to Use

1. Begin by providing your initial project scope document
2. The system will identify which expert agents to activate based on project type
3. Each agent will ask relevant questions to gather necessary information
4. You'll answer these questions to provide project details
5. The system will generate comprehensive documentation across all needed areas
6. Review the documents and request specific revisions as needed

## Documentation Output

The system produces professionally formatted documentation including:

- Project Identity & Purpose Document
- Design Philosophy Guide
- Layout & Color System Specification
- Development Roadmap
- Feature-Specific Technical Specifications

Each document follows industry best practices for structure and presentation.

## Customization

The system can be customized by:

- Adding domain-specific expert agents
- Modifying question sets for specific industries
- Adjusting document templates to match organizational standards
- Integrating with existing documentation systems

## Workflow Integration

This documentation system can integrate with:

- Project management tools
- Design systems
- Development environments
- Knowledge management platforms

## File Naming Conventions

For each expert prompt in the system, I recommend the following filenames:

1. `project_identity_expert.md` - For the Project Identity & Purpose Expert prompt
2. `design_philosophy_expert.md` - For the Design Philosophy Expert prompt
3. `visual_systems_expert.md` - For the Layout & Color System Expert prompt
4. `development_planning_expert.md` - For the Development Planning Expert prompt
5. `coupon_system_expert.md` - For the Coupon System Expert prompt
6. `order_processing_expert.md` - For the Order Processing Expert prompt

These filenames clearly indicate the purpose of each prompt while maintaining a consistent naming convention. Each file should contain the complete prompt for that particular expert agent, including the role description, question framework, and document guidelines.

The main agent that orchestrates these expert prompts could be named `documentation_agent.md` or `docgen_orchestrator.md` to indicate its role in managing the overall documentation process.
