When developing comprehensive documentation like design philosophy, layout and color scheme, and development plans for an application, gathering detailed information is essential. Here's an expanded questioning framework that incorporates both general questions and specific inquiries based on the ProfitGrocery project information you've already shared.

## User Questioning Framework

### Project Identity & Purpose Questions

1. What is the core value proposition of your application? What specific problem does it solve?

3. What are 3-5 competing applications in this space, and how will yours differentiate?
4. What emotions or feelings should users experience when using your application?
5. If your application were a person, how would you describe their personality?
6. How would you describe the relationship between your coupon-based offer system and overall shopping experience?
7. What specific user pain points does your WhatsApp marketing integration aim to address?

### Design Philosophy Questions

1. What existing brands or applications do you admire from a design perspective, and why?
2. Are there specific design styles (minimalist, playful, corporate, etc.) that you feel align with your brand?
3. What are the most important user tasks that should be emphasized in the design?
4. What level of visual complexity is appropriate for your target users?
5. Are there any cultural considerations that might influence design decisions?
6. How do you prioritize aesthetics versus functionality in areas where they might conflict?
7. You mentioned "minimalistic clean and professional design (close to material theme)" - are there specific aspects of Material Design that particularly resonate with your vision?
8. How important is it that screens "look fuller"? Would you prefer density of information or visual breathing room?
9. How should your design philosophy specifically address the coupon-based offer system that differentiates your app?

### Visual Language Questions

1. Does your company have existing brand guidelines? If so, can you share them?

4. What types of imagery would best represent your brand (photography, illustrations, icons)?
5. Are there specific metaphors or visual concepts that resonate with your product's purpose?
6. The provided screenshots show a color scheme with purple elements and green call-to-action buttons. Is this the direction you'd like to maintain or evolve?
7. Your project logo shows a black background with "PG" in a stylized white font. Should this color scheme inform the overall application design?
8. How should category modules visually differ based on their importance or function?
9. What visual indicators would best communicate the different types of offers in your system?

### Layout & Information Architecture Questions

1. What are the 3-5 most critical user journeys in your application?
2. Which features should be immediately accessible versus those that can be discovered over time?
3. How complex is the information hierarchy in your application?
4. Are there specific screens or features that should receive priority in the layout?
5. What device types and screen sizes must be supported?
6. How do you expect the layout needs to evolve as your product scales?
7. You mentioned four types of category modules of different sizes - could you elaborate on the specific content each should contain?
8. For the horizontally scrollable module, what content should be visible without scrolling versus what can be discovered?
9. How should the navigation flow handle transitions between product discovery, coupon application, and checkout?
10. What information architecture best supports the relationship between products and applicable offers?

### Development Planning Questions

1. What is your target timeline for initial release and subsequent iterations?
2. Are there any technical constraints or requirements for the development platform?
3. Which features represent your minimum viable product versus future enhancements?
4. Do you have existing backend systems that need to be integrated?
5. What are your expectations for testing and quality assurance?
6. Are there specific performance benchmarks that must be met?
7. You've outlined a phased approach starting with splash screen, login, home screen, etc. Are there dependencies between these components that should inform the development sequence?
8. What specific technical requirements does the WhatsApp deep linking integration have?
9. For the category navigation with "subtle movement to the next category" - are there performance considerations for this interaction?
10. What level of complexity do you anticipate for the coupon validation and application system?

### Coupon System Specific Questions

1. How many different types of coupon offers do you plan to support initially?
2. What are the business rules for coupon stacking or exclusivity?
3. How should the system communicate partial qualification for an offer?
4. What analytics do you need around coupon usage and conversion?
5. How frequently will new offers be introduced?
6. Will there be personalized offers, and if so, how should they be distinguished?
7. What information needs to be included in the WhatsApp deep links?
8. How should the system handle expired or fully redeemed coupons?
9. What validation rules apply to manually entered coupon codes?

### Order Processing Questions

1. What information needs to be captured during the order placement process?
2. What are the expected status transitions for an order?
3. What information should be displayed at each stage of order tracking?
4. Are there any time-based expectations for order status changes?
5. How should the system handle delivery exceptions or delays?
6. What order history data is most important to users?
7. Will order modifications be supported? If so, at what stages?
8. What order-related notifications should users receive?

## Document Structure Guidelines

### Design Philosophy Document

**Required Elements:**
1. Executive summary (1 paragraph that captures the essence)
2. Core design principles (4-6 principles with clear rationales)
3. Brand personality description (tone, voice, and character)
4. User experience priorities (hierarchical organization of priorities)
5. Visual language guidelines (typography, iconography, imagery principles)
6. Application to key user flows (how principles manifest in actual use)
7. Coupon system design philosophy (special section dedicated to this differentiator)
8. Component-first approach explanation (addressing your requirement for reusable elements)

**Presentation Format:**
- Begin with a concise mission statement
- Use clear headings and subheadings for hierarchical organization
- Include bullet points only for lists of attributes or characteristics
- Write principles as memorable statements followed by explanations
- Use comparative language ("more X than Y") to clarify positioning

3. Screen layout wireframes (core screens with component placement)
4. Complete color palette (primary, secondary, accent, functional colors)
5. Color application guidelines (which colors for which UI elements)
6. Typography specifications (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
7. State variations (default, hover, active, disabled states)
